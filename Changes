Net-RCON-Minecraft Changes

0.03    2019-12-10
        - Removed support for Perl 5.8.

0.02    2019-11-25
        - Nonce order of operations caused test failures on Perl 5.22 and
          below. This was masked on newer Perls due to the more explicit
          semantics for << and >> (bitwise shifts) introduced in 5.24.
        - Better dependency versioning

0.01    2019-11-21
        - Version the first
